# Why did i make React Machine ❔
### It all starts with this youtuber called [Jacksfilms](https://www.youtube.com/@jacksfilms), he is a really great youtuber, you should definetly check him out! And he made this cool litle programm called [React Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Ob7U231ns), which is really good, but i have found a few problems:
- ***It's not supported on GNU/Linux 🐧***
- ***It's not open-source 📂***
- ***It costs $0.69, you can only get it for free if you subscribe to his Twitch. 💸***
### Being a GNU/Linux user, an open-source enthuziast, and not the kind of person to pay $0.69 dollars for something like this. I was sad... until i realised that I'm a programmer, and i can make this myself!
*And this is how, React Machine was born!*
